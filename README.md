# VRLatency: Virtual Reality Latency Measurement 
Tests go here

## What is it
VRLatency is a python package that provides an easy way, both in terms of hardware design and software usability, to measure and analyze the latency of any projector-based virtual reality system. In fact, with this package, along the device, one can measure the latency of any display.

## TODO
- Check get_total_latency methods
- Change the stimulus positioning to be normalized to screen dimensions - DONE
- Fix the tracking experiment
- Command-line interface
