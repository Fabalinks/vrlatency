# VRLatency
A library to measure and analyze the latency of virtual reality system

## TODO

- Command-line interface
- Arduino
    - Upload arduino code without the need for arduino IDE

- not all VR systems have two screens:
    - search for number of displys using the pyglet context and if there exist a second one project onto
    it and if not then stick to the main disply
